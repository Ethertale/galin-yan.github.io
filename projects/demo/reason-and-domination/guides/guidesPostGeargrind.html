        Level 60 | 40-Player Raid | 5 Bosses
        <br><br>
        Buried under the ruined steelworks of Old Grimspark, the Geargrind Grotto is a molten maze of rotating gears, collapsing platforms, and mechanical guardians. This ancient production facility, lost for centuries, now thrums with renewed life—under the rule of a rogue AI known as the Overmind.
        <br>
        Players must brave the blazing heat and relentless assembly-line defenses to reach the Titan Forge, where war machines are being mass-produced in preparation for a mechanized uprising.
        <br>
        Inside the Forge, automated lieutenants guard control cores, and failure to disable them in time will overwhelm players with waves of enhanced constructs. Only through swift teamwork and smart positioning can the Overmind be disabled before it unleashes its perfect army.
        <br>
        Victory brings powerful gear infused with raw industrial might—and the gratitude of those living in the shadow of the machine uprising.
        <br><br>
        Boss Encounters:
        <br>
        Smeltfang – Lava-imbued canine automaton. Emits bursts of flame with tail slams. Occasionally charges and ignites gear platforms. Players must kite and rotate accordingly.
        <br>
        Corecrank – Oversized maintenance bot with a spinning core. Unleashes waves of concussive force. Players must break his legs first to expose the core for damage.
        <br>
        The Conveyor Assembly – Not a traditional boss. A timed survival gauntlet on massive conveyor belts with crushing arms, random trash mobs, and malfunctioning forgebots. Survive for 3 minutes.
        <br>
        Moltriarch AEGIS – A corrupted defensive AI housed in a tank-like construct. Casts protective barriers on adds, disables healing at intervals, and targets healers with feedback blasts.
        <br>
        Vexor, Titanforge Overseer – Final boss. Vexor’s arena constantly shifts as massive gears rotate beneath players. Mechanics include:
        <br>
        Forge Pulse – periodic AoE requiring use of cover.
        <br>
        Scrap Protocol – marks players for disposal; if not cleansed, they're pulled toward the grinder.
        <br>
        Titanbound Units – adds that tether to Vexor, granting him damage immunity unless interrupted.
        <br>
        Final phase introduces Molten Collapse, gradually shrinking the arena.
